@article{Chernozhukov2004,
abstract = {We use instrumental quantile regression approach to examine the effects of 401(k) plans on wealth using data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation. Using 401(k) eligibility as an instrument for 401(k) participation, we estimate the quantile treatment effects of participation in a 401(k) plan on several measures of wealth. The results show the effects of 401 (k) participation on net financial assets are positive and significant over the entire range of the asset distribution, and that the increase in the low tail of the assets distribution appears to translate completely into an increase in wealth. However, there is significant evidence of substitution from other forms of wealth in the upper tail of the distribution.},

abstract = {During the late 1980s, contributions to 401(k) plans eclipsed contributions to Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) as the leading form of tax-deferred individual retirement saving in the United States. In this paper we describe patterns of participation in 401(k) plans, contrast these patterns with IRA participation, and evaluate the net impact of 401(k) contributions on personal saving. We find that 401(k) participation conditional on eligibility exceeds 60% at all income levels. In contrast, IRA participation at the height of that program rose sharply with income. We use two methods to evaluate the net saving effect of 401(k) contributions on personal saving: we compare the financial assets of families who are eligible for 401(k) saving with the assets of those who are not eligible, and we consider the change over time in the assets of like groups of savers. We find little evidence that 401(k) contributions substitute for other forms of personal saving, including IRA contributions. {\textcopyright} 1995.},
